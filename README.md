# Beach Boss


Interactive puzzle game written in Java with the swing library.</br>
Beach Boss (A Sokoban variant)</p>

***Overview***</br>
Sokoban is PSPACE-Complete due to not only the branching factor but also the enormous tree search depth. Iteration of the game state requires an exponentially growing number of moves.</br>

Algorithms are not able to solve this in non-deterministic polynomial time (let alone polynomial time), and so heuristics are the only feasible approach.</br>



<br>Limitations: No graphics library</br>

Features: Simple map generator based on breadth-first search traversal.

Not a perfect product but definitely still playable.
