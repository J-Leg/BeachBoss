# Beach Boss


Interactive puzzle game written in Java with the swing library.</br>
Beach Boss (A Sokoban variant)</p>

***Overview***</br>
Sokoban is PSPACE-Complete due to not only the branching factor but also the enormous tree search depth. Iteration of the game state requires an exponentially growing number of moves.</br>

There is no deterministic polynomial time algorithm (let alone non-deterministic p-time algorithm) to solve these problems, and so heuristics are the only feasible approach.</p>


***Game Details***</br>
<Limitations: No graphics library</br>
Features: Simple map generator based on breadth-first search traversal.</br>
Algorithm: Revolves around a simple heuristic and edge cases (NOT PERFECT)
